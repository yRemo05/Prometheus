# What is this?

**Prometheus** is a spelling checker and also a corrector. It uses *pynput* for keyboard hooks and functions. It is worth mentioning that this project is really basic level. If your WPM is above 90, I do not recommend using prometheus since it runs synchronously without word location tracking which might cause complex mistakes if you are typing so fast. It uses `Word` from *textblob* library for confidence check. Feel free to upgrade this. PR's are welcome.
